# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

---

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- **The submitted project must have a verifiable builder/person who is building in public.**
- The intent of this list is to gather awesome products/services *that most users would need*. This is not the place for pointless advertisements, or non-public building things.
- Submitted pull requests may include closed/open-source products/services.
- Don't open a Draft / WIP pull request while you work on the guidelines. A pull request should be 100% ready and should adhere to all the guidelines when you open it.
- The submissions must be high-quality and competant in their category.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[Product/Service](link) on [@building in public source](link) - Concise product description.`
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- Link to the about/landing page of the website (whichever provides direct explaination of the project).
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Descriptions should not be marketing taglines.
- Descriptions should not be title-case.
- Avoid mentioning `Building-in-public` in the description as it's implied.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the project and why it should be included.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request.

Thank you for your suggestion!

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
